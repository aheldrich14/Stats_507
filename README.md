## Stats 507 PS6

The purpose of this repo is to test the git workflow and push changes made locally to a remote host. The repo contains a [python script](./PS2_Q3.py) extracted from a prior problem set.

This script will read in NHANES data that has been saved locally and will do
various transformations and cleaning of the data. It will save two pickle files
containing demographic and oral health information and prints out the number
of cases in both files.
